# Quest to save the Realm of Python!

Hello! This is an ASCII game that I built using object-oriented programming in Python. The game is played in the terminal and is based on a fictional fantasy realm.
Players are able to build their own characters which enable a customized feel to the game. Players are then able to fight monsters as many times as they want to build up their
stats to face off against the boss monster 'Emberling the Giant Python'!

## Features

- The program accepts user input to create a customized character at the start of the game.
- Using Python data structures and object-oriented programming players are able to fight endless waves of enemies.
- Random number generation is used to determine which monsters the player fights and the attack patterns of both the player and monsters
- Utilizing class inheritance enables expansion in the game to include more monster types

## How to Use

After running the Python file, players will be greeted and asked for input in order to create their characters. After the player character is generated they are then prompted to
begin fighting monsters. The types of monsters the player fights as well as the attack patterns of both the monster and the player are decided by random number generation. If the
player successfully defeats a monster their health is replenished, increased and they also recieve a boost to all stats. The more monsters a player defeats the better prepared they
will be to fight the boss. If the player successfully defeats the boss the program ends. If the player at any point dies the program ends.
